# FlockingGame:
Game based on flocking behaviour.

# Rules:
A bunch of good guys and bad guys are randomly created in the environment.
Good guys have a flocking behaviour.
Bad guys hunt good guys and try to eat them.
Your goal is to keep at least one good guy alive, for the longest time possible.

# Commands:
Left click can be used to bait good guys.
But be careful, you have to create the bait in their sight angle, and not too far from them, otherwise it won't work.
You can also use your right click to repel bad guys, if you feel to pressured by them. Once again, repelers have a limited
area of effect.
You can have only one bait and repeler active.
